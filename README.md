# Project-SMC
Some codes of a research project on Sequential Monte Carlos algorithms.

The goal of this project was to create a statistical tool for automatic news classification, as in a supervised learning problem. Due to the temporal dependence in news gathering, the idea was to develop a logistic model where the regression coefficients are sparse and vary over time, obtaining a model compatible with a non-linear and non-Gaussian state space model.
